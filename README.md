# Missile Wars Cosmetics Mod

*I made this mod so I can use shaders in CubeKrowd Missile Wars*

## Features:

- (`/cbr`) Toggle the bedrock layer above the game map
- (`/ctime`) Set the client-side time to adjust shader lighting conditions
- (`/cdl`) Better performance! Who needs a lighting engine anyways?

## Notice

- The mod is only maintained when I decide to play MissileWars with shaders... so it is only for CubeKrowd Missile Wars or MissileWarsX.
- The code quality is abominable, but I don't careeee.
- Feel free to fix things & add more features, just make a pr

## Installation.

Just download the jar file from the releases into your **fabric** mods folder. (Currently for 1.19.x)
